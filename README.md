# markdown for signal / molly

A repository to work on the Markdown parser I am writing for use in the Signal / Molly Android apps.
I have a potato laptop so having the full Signal / Molly project open in an IDE bogs down my machine.
This repo lets me test the string parsing without all the overhead of the full Android app.
I use mock-ups of the types defined in Signal / Molly to be able to write my logic as though it resides in the Signal / Molly code base.
